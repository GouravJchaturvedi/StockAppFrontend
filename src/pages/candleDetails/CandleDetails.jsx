      title: "The Doji Candlestick",
      description: `The Doji candlestick is a key indicator in technical analysis, representing a point of indecision in the market.
      It forms when the opening and closing prices are nearly identical, creating a cross or a plus-shaped pattern.
      Traders often interpret the Doji as a signal to watch for confirmation from the next candlestick before making trading decisions.
      When found in a trend, it may signal a potential reversal or continuation, depending on the surrounding context and volume.`,

      structure: [
        {
          name: "Body",
          detail: "Extremely small or non-existent, reflecting the minimal difference between the opening and closing prices.",

          name: "Shadows (Wicks)",
          detail: "Can be long or short. The shadows' length indicates the price movement range during the period.",
        },
      ],
      interpretation: `The Doji candlestick is a powerful indicator of indecision. Its effectiveness is amplified when found in key support or resistance zones.
      - A Doji near resistance suggests that buyers are struggling, increasing the likelihood of a trend reversal.
      - When a Doji forms near strong support, it may indicate that selling pressure is exhausting, signaling an upward move.
      - Traders often combine Doji patterns with RSI or MACD indicators for enhanced accuracy in predicting market movements.`,

    Hammer: {
      title: "The Hammer Candlestick",
      description: `The Hammer candlestick is a bullish reversal pattern that typically appears at the end of a downtrend.
      It consists of a small real body near the top and a long lower shadow at least twice the bodyâ€™s size.
      This pattern suggests that buyers have started overpowering sellers, potentially leading to an upward price movement.`,
      image: "/Hammer.png",
      structure: [
        {
          name: "Real Body",
          detail: "Small and positioned at the top of the candlestick.",
        },
        {
          name: "Lower Shadow",
          detail: "Long, at least twice the size of the real body, showing rejection of lower prices.",
        },
      ],
      interpretation: `A Hammer suggests that the market is testing lower levels but failing to hold them, indicating potential reversal.
      - If found at a **major support level**, the Hammer is a strong bullish signal.
      - A Hammer should be confirmed by a bullish candle in the next session before entering a trade.
      - Traders often pair Hammer patterns with **Fibonacci retracement levels** to enhance entry and exit strategies.`,
